# Ahmed Muharram - Developer Portfolio
## Live at [https://muharram.dev](https://muharram.dev)!

Welcome to my developer portfolio's github repo! 

## Features

- Animated GIF background: a rainy background scene for a calming experience while browsing the portfolio.

- Rain Slider: a rain slider that allows you to toggle the rain sound effects on or off. It provides an interactive element to the portfolio to match the background, giving you control over your experience.

- Animations: the portfolio has various animations to enhance the user experience. They add a dynamic and engaging touch to the portfolio.

## Technologies Used

The portfolio as of last commit uses plain HTML, CSS, and JS only.

## WIP

- Adding a contact page.
- Adding projects.
- Connecting the navbar to these pages using animations.

## Known problems

- The rain slider does not work with Safari yet.
- The website does not provide a smooth mobile experience yet.
